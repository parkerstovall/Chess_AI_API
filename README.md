# Chess AI Game

This is a custom build chess AI game that stores games in a local Mongo DB ran on a docker image.

To run the app, do the following in two separate terminals:

- npm run build:css (This only needs to be done the first run)
- npm run start:db
- npm run start:app

Alternatively, to run the latest images from the container registry, download and compose "docker-compose-latest.yml" from the root of the repo.
